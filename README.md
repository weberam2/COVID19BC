# COVID19BC
Tracking COVID19 in BC Canada

This repo has an RMarkdown and a Jupyter Notebook in Python

The Markdown is tracking and trying to predict future New Daily Cases in BC
The predictions are based, currently, on an exponential growth model (take the log and then perform a linear regression)

The notebook is based on someone else's work entirely (u/anecdotalmedicine on reddit), and tries to predict the sigmoidal shape the total cases take when governments take action (or even its natural progress in the worst case scenario)
